## Code Repository of BAM!

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We are **BAMresearch**, the GitHub repository of the [German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html).

üó∫Ô∏è We are located in Berlin/Germany and we are (mostly) researchers from fields connected to materials research and testing (Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Engineering)!

üß™ Our code is based on research projects from different research groups, departments and divisions within BAM. At BAM we value and support [open source software](https://github.com/BAMresearch/.oss)! Our software projects are [free and open source by default](https://github.com/BAMresearch/.oss-strategy)!

A selection of our code projects (alphabetical order):
* *LobsterPy*: [https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy](https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy): A package for automated bonding analysis in the field of computational materials science
* *Mistle*: [https://github.com/BAMeScience/Mistle](https://github.com/BAMeScience/Mistle): Mistle is a fast spectral search engine. It uses a fragment-indexing technique and SIMD intrinsics to match experimental MS2 spectra to large spectral libraries at a high performance.
* *PepGM*: [https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM](https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM): A probabilistic graphical model for taxonomic inference of viral proteome samples with associated confidence scores 
* *SLAMD*: [https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM](https://github.com/Mat-O-Lab/WEBSLAMD/tree/main): An open source web app for data driven acceleration of cement and concrete development through digital lab twin and AI optimization (**Python/javascript**).
