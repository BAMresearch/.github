## Code Repository of BAM!

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We are **BAMresearch**, the GitHub repository of the [German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html).

üó∫Ô∏è We are located in Berlin/Germany and we are (mostly) researchers from fields connected to materials research and testing (Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Engineering)!

üß™ Our code is based on research projects from different research groups, departments, and divisions within BAM. At BAM, we value and support [open source software](https://github.com/BAMresearch/.oss)! Our software projects are [free and open source by default](https://github.com/BAMresearch/.oss-strategy)!

## Curated List of repositories

A curated list of our repositories, tools, and software projects can be found in our organizations [awesome-BAMresearch repository](https://github.com/BAMresearch/awesome-BAMresearch)! Please have a look and enjoy! üéâ

A selection in alphabetical order:
* *LobsterPy*: [https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy](https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy): A package for automated bonding analysis in the field of computational materials science
* *Autoplex*: [https://github.com/autoatml/autoplex](https://github.com/autoatml/autoplex): A package for generating and benchmarking machine learning (ML)-based interatomic potentials. 
* *Mistle*: [https://github.com/BAMeScience/Mistle](https://github.com/BAMeScience/Mistle): Mistle is a fast spectral search engine. It uses a fragment-indexing technique and SIMD intrinsics to match experimental MS2 spectra to large spectral libraries at a high performance.
* *PepGM*: [https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM](https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM): A probabilistic graphical model for taxonomic inference of viral proteome samples with associated confidence scores
