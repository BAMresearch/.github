## Hello! 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are **BAMresearch**, the GitHub repository of the [German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html).  

🗺️ We are located in Berlin/Germany and we are (mostly) researchers from fields connected to materials research and testing (Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Engineering)!

🧪 Our code is based on research projects from different research groups, departments and divisions within BAM. Our code projects so far are (alphabetical order):


* ...
* *LobsterPy*: [https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy](https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy): a package for automated bonding analysis in the field of computational materials science
* ...

Everyone from BAM is invited to add their code project via pull request.

🔧 We can not guarantee stability, further development or support. 

That's it. Have fun! 🎉
